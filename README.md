# Parabola
 
Once only intended for Parabolas, this Neural Network tries to separate 2D Points according to some function.

This is a javascript implementation of a fully connected Neural Network.
It uses the Sigmoid activation Function.

A Gradient free "Optimization" method is used:

1. It picks a random direction in the Parameter Space
2. It follows this direction as long the Error goes down
3. If the Error goes up again it starts at step 1
